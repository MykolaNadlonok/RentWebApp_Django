I have created a web application in Django framework, which is connected with a relational
database in MySql. That simple application allows to rent a car in one of the biggest 60 cities in
the USA.

1. The whole application is in the folder "django_project"

2. The description of the application, python script and csv files can be found in the folder "additional files"
